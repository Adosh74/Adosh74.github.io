I'm **Mohamed Shebl** a software engineer specializing in backend development using Node.js and Express. With expertise in these technologies, I have a strong foundation in building robust and scalable backend solutions. With proficiency in C/C++, Java, JavaScript, Typescript, SQL/NoSQL, and RESTful APIs, I can effectively design and implement backend systems. Additionally, my experience with Git/GitHub, OOP, UML, Docker, and React allows me to collaborate efficiently and deliver high-quality results. And I'm interested in learning distributed systems. :technologist:

This is my blog I write about my projects, some of my skills and the tools I use.
